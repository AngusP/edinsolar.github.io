          Edinsolar is a team of students at Edinburgh University spanning three major disciplines - 
          Engineering, Computer Science and Business. Weâ€™re designing and building a solar powered 
          car to race in the 2017 <a href="http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge</a> 
          in Australia. Our car will be in the cruiser  class - designed to both in form and function 
          resemble the vehicles we see on the road today. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility 
          of renewable energy use in personal transportation and to build on and improve existing 
          technologies in the field of sustainable transportation.
