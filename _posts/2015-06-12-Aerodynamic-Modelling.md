The aerodynamics team at Edinsolar is busy testing and improving the aerodynamic shell for the proof of concept vehicle. With such a small amount of power available from the regulation size solar panels, it is vital for a solar ev to pe as low drag as possible - a modern SUV can get away with a flat front and large drag factor, but our solar car will have to be as slippery as possible.

The Aero team is using CDF, or Computational Fluid Dynamics to model hot the carâ€™s shell will interact with the air as it moves, allowing them to discover and eliminate sources of drag. This can be a difficult challenge, as the most aerodynamic shape is usually not the most practical for a car.
