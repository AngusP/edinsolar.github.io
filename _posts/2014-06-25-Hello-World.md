Edinsolar, the University of Edinburgh's solar car team has recently formed. We’re a group of undergraduate students studying a mix of Business, Computer Science, Engineering and more. We’re planning to enter the 2017 World Solar Challenge, an event that runs once every two years in Australia. Teams from around the world race across the outback not just for fun but to improve and expand our current engineering capabilities for self-contained sustainable transport.

We’re looking forward to developing our car and we think we’re already on-track for some world-firsts in the solar car field. Early development on the chassis, power train, aerodynamic shell and onboard computer has already begun, and while the details will have to wait, we aim to put as much content here as possible as the car develops.
