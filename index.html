        <h2 class="">Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Edinsolar is a student-led initiative with learning at its core. We intend to design and manufacture generations of solar powered vehicles which both in form and function resemble the vehicles we see on the road today. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of renewable energy use in personal transportation and bring new technologies from theory to practice in the field of sustainable transportation.</p>

        <p>We complement our university learning by working as a multidisciplinary team on a large scale project and building practical knowledge. Edinsolar collaborates with industry, contributing to growth and innovation in advancing technologies. In addition, we will be sharing our passion through outreach, with the aim of generating long-term interest for the next generation of students.</p>

        <h3 class="jumbo text-center">The WSC</h3>
        <p>The world solar challenge is an international competition of solar powered vehicles, held every other year in Australia. the race stretches 3000 kilometres from Darwin to Adelaide. The WSC is an established race, considered the most prestigious and challenging solar race, since it was first held three decades ago.</p>

        <p>The race centres around promotion of the imperatives of sustainable transport and its practicality and acceptance within the automotive industry. After an initial charge, all energy must come from the sun or through kinetic recovery. Edinsolar participates in the cruiser class, with the objective of building a car suitable for everyday use. It fits four passengers comfortably and resembles a standard car. It is coated with approximately six square metres solar cells. The ideal of this class is to strive to design a solar vehicle that improves our current transport for the future.</p>

        <p>Edinsolar is a team of 27 students from the School of Engineering, School of Informatics and the Business School of the University of Edinburgh. Our structure comprises of electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics, computing and business subgroups.</p>

        <p>We are looking to design and build a solar-powered, family sized car in order to compete in the 2017 World Solar Challenge. Learning is at the very core of our project, and we strongly believe in student project leadership and in-house development. We collaborate with faculty members across the University for guidance. The learning does not stop at the Edinsolar team; we also look to engage in outreach with Schools once we have a prototype to promote STEM, and to collaborate with industry to look for new applications of technology to enhance the field of renewable automotive engineering.</p>
